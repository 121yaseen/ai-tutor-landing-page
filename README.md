# AI Tutor - Futuristic "Coming Soon" Landing Page

This project contains the foundational HTML and CSS for a "Coming Soon" landing page for an AI-powered education technology startup.

## Project Goal

To create a futuristic, dark-themed, and engaging landing page that:
- Announces the upcoming AI tutor product.
- Explains its core value proposition (hyper-personalized learning).
- Highlights the 3-step AI process and key features.
- Targets students preparing for competitive exams (JEE, NEET, UPSC, Abroad studies).
- Encourages users to join a waitlist.
- Takes design inspiration from `huly.io` and `shadcn/ui` aesthetics.

## Files

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML structure for the landing page.
- **`css/style.css`**: CSS for styling the page, including the dark theme, "Space Grotesk" font, and styles inspired by `shadcn/ui`.
- **`assets/`**: A directory intended for images, icons, and other static assets. (Currently empty, you'll need to add your visuals here).

## Key Design Elements & Technologies Used (Conceptually)

- **Font:** "Space Grotesk" (imported via Google Fonts).
- **Theme:** Dark theme with futuristic accents.
- **UI Components Inspiration:** `shadcn/ui` ([https://ui.shadcn.com/](https://ui.shadcn.com/)). The current CSS attempts to emulate this style with static HTML/CSS. For direct `shadcn/ui` usage, you would typically use a React/Next.js environment with Tailwind CSS.
- **Icons:** Placeholder comments indicate where icons should be placed. It is recommended to use a modern SVG icon library like [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) or [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).
- **Responsive Design:** The CSS includes basic considerations for responsiveness, but further refinement will be needed for a perfect experience across all devices.

## Getting Started & Further Development

1.  **Review the Code:** Familiarize yourself with `index.html` and `css/style.css`.
2.  **Add Visuals:**
    *   Source or create a futuristic background image/video for the hero section.
    *   Design or find appropriate icons for the "How It Works" and "Features" sections.
    *   Consider a logo for the header.
    *   Place these assets in the `assets/` directory and update the paths in `index.html` and `style.css`.
3.  **Refine Styles:**
    *   Adjust colors, spacing, and animations in `css/style.css` to perfectly match your vision.
    *   Implement more sophisticated futuristic UI elements (e.g., subtle glows, gradient accents, micro-interactions).
    *   Enhance responsiveness with more detailed media queries.
4.  **Waitlist Form Backend:**
    *   The current form in `index.html` is a basic HTML form. You'll need to connect it to a backend service to actually collect email addresses (e.g., Netlify Forms, Formspree, Mailchimp, or a custom backend).
5.  **JavaScript for Interactivity (Optional):**
    *   Add JavaScript for smooth scrolling, on-scroll animations, or more complex form validation if desired.
6.  **(Optional) Transition to a Framework:**
    *   If you plan to build a more complex application, consider rebuilding this landing page using a modern JavaScript framework like React or Next.js. This would allow you to directly integrate `shadcn/ui` components and leverage Tailwind CSS effectively.
